Jaguar ROM Splitter is a simple application to help you prepare files for flashing to ROM. 

It replaces DOS program **romsplit** that splits .j64 or .jag file to HI and LO binary images.

If you are using the popular tl866 progarmmator, you will need a special adapter to flash the 27c160, and the binaries will need to be divided into 512kB parts. I have added this option to the program as well.
